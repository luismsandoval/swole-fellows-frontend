   - Start every workday with a meeting where we go over specific tasks we need accomplished and properly assign those tasks based on teammates strengths. End with another wrap up meeting by close of business.

## Conflict Plan

1. What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    - If there are any issues that need to be resolved, the team will meet to discuss them. Any grievances will be discussed and resolved. <br/><br/>

3. How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
   - Tasks will be assigned based on skill level. If a team member is stuck on something, the others will help them get over it and teach them what they know. <br/><br/>

4. How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
   - We will have a team meeting where we again will go over teammate specific tasks to ensure that all team members are adequately contributing. <br/><br/>
